								<h3>Our Story</h3>
								<p>AirBae was founded in an effort to make the in-flight experience of all travelers more enjoyable. It is a web-application that allows fliers to get to know their neighbors before choosing a seat. Fliers that enjoy getting to know their neighbors will be able to choose a seat next to somebody that is willing to talk to them. A flier can even indicate whether they like to work, sleep, get up, etc and other fliers will be made aware of these preferences before they select their own seat. This way, like-minded fliers will be able to sit nearby one another, making travel more satisfying for all.</p>

								<!--
								<h4>Who are we?</h4>
								<p>Our team is comprised of two undergraduate computer science majors, both of whom have extensive backgrounds in web development. Collectively, we have interned at six different companies of varying size and industry working in software development,product management, business analytics, and marketing. We are well-versed in web development through our coursework and numerous independent projects, many of which have a similar underlying back-end architecture to AirBae. Himica is minoring in entrepreneurship and works closely with a professor at a business school, who from personal experience, has provided resources and guidance on how to build a technology startup. Himica has also been the tech lead for a different startup that is now part of an ncubator program at a state university. Both Shruti and Himica have collaborated on projects successfully in the past and have a team dynamic that promotes efficiency and open communication.</p>
